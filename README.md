# google-homepage

TOP mini-project to deconstruct and reconstruct a web page.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Constructed Google's home page using a flex-box design - this design is somewhat more responsive than Google's actual page in terms of headers and footers moving with resizing windows.

No focus was given to smaller media style screens, although the design does resize fine for media screens due to flex-box's nature.


No link functionality was added & special graphics outside of the logo and magnifying glass inside the search bar were omitted and replaced with text.  Voice search icon was omitted completely.

While Google's home page is fairly simple, this was a good exercise to test positioning of elements with CSS.  I used a minor amount of animation to highlight the search bar on mouse-over, and rendered the svg element Google actually uses for the magnifying glass into an svg file to use as a background image inside the search bar I constructed.

The search bar is not implemented as a true form and does not submit.  It also does not have the clear functionality - no javaScript was implemented in this design exercise.

In addition to minor animation, there is a fair amount of :hover states implemented as well.
